## Original data in this repository
Unless otherwise stated below, the original datasets included in this repository (e.g., CSV files under `Dataframes/` that were generated by the authors as part of the project) are licensed under:

## Third-party datasets and derivatives (not covered by CC BY 4.0)

### 1) Copernicus/ESA land-cover (derived raster)
This repository includes a **derived, cropped** land-cover raster:

`Dataframes/Land use mapping/lccs_class_2022_v2.1.1_crop_sites_5kmplus500m.tif`

This file was generated from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) “satellite land cover” product (ESA CCI / C3S land cover). Use of the upstream product (and any derivatives) is governed by the CDS/ESA licence terms, not by CC BY 4.0.

### 2) Visual Crossing weather data (not redistributed here)
Weather covariates used in the manuscript were derived from Visual Crossing daily weather downloads obtained during a time-limited paid subscription.

**This repository does not redistribute:**
- raw Visual Crossing daily CSV downloads; or
- any Visual Crossing-hosted datasets.

The script `Additional analyses/Weather data processing_Additional.R` is included for transparency to document how seasonal summaries were computed, but reproducing those summaries by way of raw data inputs requires users to obtain their own weather time series under an appropriate licence.

If you reuse repository data covered by CC BY 4.0, please cite the associated manuscript (DOI to be added) and this repository. For third-party governed inputs (Copernicus/ESA land cover; Visual Crossing), consult and comply with the linked terms in addition to citing the upstream sources.
